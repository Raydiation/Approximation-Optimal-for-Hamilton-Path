Currently, only brute force and SA(Simulated annealing)  
Althought Dynamic Programming is a best strategy for the small case, but it need a lot of space and more difficult to implement, I didn't do it.

Add Ant colony optimization algorithms(ACO). Although the result is on a good way but it's a trouble for me to adjust the parameters.
